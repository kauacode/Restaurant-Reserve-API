# üçΩÔ∏è RESTAURANT MANAGEMENT API

## üìå Restaurant Reservation API  
This is a **Node.js** API built with **TypeScript**, Express, and Sequelize for managing restaurant reservations. It includes various features that allow users and administrators to efficiently book tables, check availability, and manage reservations. The API offers:
```sh
User Authentication:

Users can register and log in to the system using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication.
JWT is used to generate access tokens that allow users to access protected endpoints such as creating or canceling reservations.
Table Management:

Administrators can manage tables in the restaurant, including their availability and capacity.
The API allows creating new tables, updating existing ones, and deleting tables if necessary.
Each table has attributes like availability, capacity, and status (whether it's available, reserved, etc.).
Reservation System:

Users can create reservations by selecting a table and booking a time slot.
They can also check the availability of tables before making a reservation.
Administrators have access to all reservations, including the ability to cancel or modify them.
Data Validation:

Zod is used for validating incoming data, such as ensuring that reservation times are in the correct format and that tables are being booked correctly.
API Documentation with Swagger:

Swagger is integrated to automatically generate detailed API documentation, making it easier for developers to understand and test the API's endpoints.
It provides an interactive UI for exploring the API, viewing descriptions of each endpoint, and testing the endpoints directly.
Database Integration:

The API integrates with a MySQL database using Sequelize to handle the persistence of data such as tables, reservations, and user information.
The database schema is designed to store essential information about tables, reservations, and users, with relationships to ensure data integrity.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup  
```sh
To get started with this project, follow the steps below.

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Install Node.js**  
Before starting, make sure you have **Node.js** installed. You can download and install the latest version of Node.js from the official website: [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org/).  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Install TypeScript**  
You also need **TypeScript** installed globally. Run the following command in your terminal:
npm install -g typescript

3Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the repository  
git clone https://github.com/kauacode/Restaurant-Reserve-API.git
cd restaurant-reserve

4Ô∏è‚É£ Install dependencies
npm install

5Ô∏è‚É£Ô∏è Configure environment variables
Create a .env file based on .env.example:
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
DB_NAME=restaurant_reserve
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
PORT=3000

6Ô∏è‚É£Ô∏è Database Setup
To create the database and tables, execute one of the following methods:

üìå Method 1: Using the SQL dump
Run the following command in your terminal:
mysql -u root -p < database.sql
This will automatically create the database and tables.

üìå Method 2: Creating the database manually
If you prefer to create it manually:
Access MySQL Workbench or the MySQL terminal.
Create the database:
CREATE DATABASE restaurant_reserve;
Select the database and run the database.sql dump.

7Ô∏è‚É£Ô∏è Start the application
Development mode:
npm run dev
Production mode:
npm run build && npm start
```
